Let's talk about how to make:

- [**Pesto**](#pesto)
- [**Salsa Verde**](#salsa)
- **Guacamole**
- **Epis**
- **Gravy**

### Hummus <a id="hummus"></a>
Alton Brown once said hummus has all the essential amino you need to survive. Does this
mean that I could survive on nothing but hummus? Less of a challenge than it sounds for me.
Unlike some of the other items on this list, it's easy to make a lot of it and it tastes good
with just about everything. All you need are:

#### Ingredients
- a blender (you should wash it first)
- a coffee grinder (preferably with no coffee in it)
- some tahini (I wouldn't recommend peanut butter, unless you're weird like that)
- some garlic (crushed in the grinder)
- lemon juice (buy it in a bottle, it's easier)
- olive oil (or some oil)
- a can of chickpeas
- salt
- if you're extra, add some paprika, cayenne, or cumin

I don't give exact amounts because it's up to you to figure out what ingredients you
want more of and what you want less of. Get creative!

Put the tahini in the blender, add the garlic and lemon juice, and then blend it to 
get the base. You want to make sure that it's all mixed well, and that you don't have
big chunks of garlic. Drain the chickpeas but **save the water**! Add the chickpeas into
the blender. If it's too chunky, add some of the aquafaba (fancy word, right? It's that
water from the chickpeas) and the olive oil until it gets smoother. 

Once it's all mixed, you can add the salt and spices and taste it until it's what you like.

### Pesto <a id="pesto"></a>
This is a fancy one - you won't make a lot, but what's cool is that you can
make lots of substitutions and change the consistency and flavor to your liking.
You don't have to make pesto like they do at the pizza place! The first time I made it,
it was like zesty peanut butter more than anything (not bad!), and the second time (with more oil)
it was more like the pizza place. But both times it was good.

#### Ingredients
- nuts (pistachio, almonds, walnuts, pine nuts, macadamia whatever)
- olive oil (you gotta be picky about this one, you need the flavor!)
- parmesan cheese (grated and powdery, not that flaky stringy shit)
- some herbs (basil, mint, or oregano - they all bring a different flavor)

Grind the nuts in the grinder, a little at a time so you're not cutting up
the grinder. The nuts should turn into a paste. Put the paste in the blender.
Grind the herbs too (or mince them), and into the blender. Then add the parmesan.

Blend it all together, and then start adding the olive oil until it's at your
desired consistency.

You probably won't make a lot, but it tastes really good! The choice of nuts has
the most impact on the flavor - pistachio is sweet, almonds and walnuts are more earthy.
